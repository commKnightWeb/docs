# CDN Manager

CDN Manager is a **multi-tenant CDN management platform** that enables organizations to manage fleets of Caddy servers and offer CDN services to their customers. The platform provides centralized configuration management, real-time monitoring, bandwidth quota enforcement, and automated server provisioning.

## What is CDN Manager?

CDN Manager acts as a control plane for Caddy Server deployments, allowing you to:

- **Manage multiple tenants** - Each tenant operates independently with their own servers and customers
- **Deploy CDN services** - Configure reverse proxies, SSL/TLS, load balancing, and caching
- **Monitor performance** - Track bandwidth usage, server health, and access logs
- **Automate operations** - Install Caddy servers remotely, deploy configurations, and manage certificates

## Key features

### Multi-tenancy

Three-tier user hierarchy provides complete isolation:

- **Super Admin** - Manages tenants and system settings
- **Tenant Admin** - Manages server infrastructure and companies
- **Company Admin** - Manages CDN services and deployments

### Server pool architecture

Separate test and production environments:

- **Test pools** - Pre-production testing with auto-generated test domains
- **Production pools** - Live traffic with custom domains
- **Flexible assignment** - Each company can use different pools

### Configuration management

Version-controlled deployments with immutable snapshots:

- **Service versions** - Track every configuration change
- **Config snapshots** - Immutable records of deployed state
- **Change detection** - See exactly what changed between versions
- **Rollback support** - Revert to previous configurations

### Domain registry

Centralized domain management with LIVE operations:

- **Source of truth** - Single registry for all domain state
- **Per-domain SSL** - Configure SSL independently per domain
- **LIVE add/remove** - Update domains without full redeployment
- **Health tracking** - Monitor DNS, certificates, and availability

### SSL/TLS automation

Flexible certificate management:

- **Automatic ACME** - Let's Encrypt, ZeroSSL, or Buypass
- **Custom certificates** - Upload your own certificates
- **On-demand TLS** - Issue certificates on first request
- **Per-domain control** - Different SSL modes per domain

### Authentication & authorization

Multiple authentication methods:

- **Basic auth** - Username/password authentication
- **API keys** - Token-based access control
- **JWT validation** - Integrate with identity providers
- **Forward auth** - Delegate to external auth services

### Load balancing

Advanced upstream configuration:

- **Multiple targets** - Distribute traffic across backends
- **LB policies** - Round robin, least connections, IP hash, and more
- **Health checks** - Active and passive health monitoring
- **Session affinity** - Sticky sessions via cookies or headers

### Real-time operations

Live updates and monitoring:

- **WebSocket streaming** - Real-time installation progress
- **Background jobs** - Async processing with BullMQ
- **Cascading changes** - Auto-deploy when shared resources change
- **Heartbeat monitoring** - Track server health

## Architecture overview

CDN Manager is built as a modular monolith with the following components:

- **Backend API** - Node.js, Fastify, Prisma (PostgreSQL)
- **Frontend** - React 18, Vite, Tailwind CSS
- **Worker** - BullMQ for background jobs
- **Redis** - Cache, job queue, and pub/sub
- **Caddy Server** - Reverse proxy and CDN backend

## Use cases

### CDN service provider

Offer CDN services to multiple customers with isolated configurations and billing.

### Multi-region deployment

Manage Caddy servers across different geographic regions with centralized control.

### Development & staging

Separate test and production environments with auto-generated test domains.

### Enterprise CDN

Internal CDN platform for large organizations with multiple business units.
